# Contributions

Want to add your project? Please adhere to these guidelines:

## Guidelines

- **Search for duplicates first.** Check the existing list before submitting. If your project is already there, no need to submit a duplicate PR.
- **Use the correct format:** `[Name](link) - Description`
- **Keep descriptions short and simple.** One sentence. Short and sweet description.
- **Title your PR with the project name and section it should belong to.** Not "added my cool thing" — just the project name and section.

## Example

```markdown
- [My Project](https://github.com/user/my-project) - A brief description of what it does
```
